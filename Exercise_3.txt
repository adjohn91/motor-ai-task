Enough training data that feature roads with substantial tree should be fed to algorithm, that ways it learns to handle such scenario.
multiple classes for vegetaion such as shrub should be created, to enhance the learning and adaptation of the algorithm to trees.
The possibility of creating a mask with the NIR band to get rid of the trees may exist.
manual annotation on images such as trees, where they appear on roads, could boost the quality of occluded feauture example prediction.
